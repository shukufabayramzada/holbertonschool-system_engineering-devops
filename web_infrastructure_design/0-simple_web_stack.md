# One Server Web Infrastructure Design for www.foobar.com

<a href="https://ibb.co/bWzmTjT"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gjz9NbN/task-0.png" alt="task-0" border="0"></a>

## Overview

This project outlines the design of a simple web infrastructure that serves a website at **www.foobar.com**. It consists of a single server that runs the following components:

- **Nginx** as the web server
- **PHP-FPM** (or another application server) to process application logic
- **MySQL** as the database
- **foobar.com** domain with DNS configuration

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. **Server**

The entire infrastructure is hosted on a single server. This server handles all components, including the web server, application server, and database. The server has a public IP address: **8.8.8.8**.

### 2. **Domain Name**

The domain name for the website is **foobar.com**. The domain is configured with a **DNS A record** for `www.foobar.com`, which points to the server’s IP address (8.8.8.8). This allows users to access the website via `www.foobar.com` instead of the raw IP address.

- **Domain**: `foobar.com`
- **DNS A Record**: `www.foobar.com` → `8.8.8.8`

### 3. **Web Server (Nginx)**

**Nginx** is used as the web server. It handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from users' browsers and performs the following roles:

- Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
- Forwards dynamic requests to the application server (PHP-FPM)
- Manages load balancing and caching (in more advanced setups)

### 4. **Application Server**

The application logic is executed by an **application server**. For PHP-based applications, **PHP-FPM** is used. For other programming languages, you can substitute with appropriate application servers like **Gunicorn** for Python, etc.

- Receives requests forwarded by Nginx
- Executes application logic
- Fetches data from the database (if necessary)
- Sends responses back to Nginx to be served to the user

### 5. **Database (MySQL)**

A **MySQL** database stores all the dynamic data for the website. This could include user profiles, content, settings, etc. The application server interacts with the database to retrieve or store data as needed.

### 6. **Communication Protocol**

The server communicates with the user’s browser using the **HTTP/HTTPS** protocol over **TCP/IP**. The domain is accessible via a browser using `http://www.foobar.com` or `https://www.foobar.com`.

## Request Workflow

1. **User Access Request**: A user enters `www.foobar.com` in their browser.
2. **DNS Resolution**: The domain name is resolved via DNS to the server’s IP address (8.8.8.8).
3. **Web Server (Nginx)**: The browser sends a request to the server. Nginx receives it and serves static content or forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
4. **Application Server**: Nginx passes dynamic requests to the application server. The application processes the request, interacts with the MySQL database if needed, and returns a response.
5. **Database (MySQL)**: If required, the application queries the MySQL database to fetch or store data.
6. **Response**: The application server returns the response to Nginx, which then delivers it to the user’s browser.

## Infrastructure Issues

### 1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**

Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in the server (hardware, software, or network) would bring down the entire website.

- **Solution**: Implement redundancy by introducing multiple servers with load balancing to distribute traffic.

### 2. **Downtime during Maintenance/Deployments**

When updating the application code or performing server maintenance, the server needs to be restarted. This results in website downtime.

- **Solution**: Use techniques like **blue-green deployment** or **rolling updates** to reduce downtime during code updates.

### 3. **Scalability Issues**

The single server has limited resources. If the website traffic increases significantly, the server might get overwhelmed, causing slow response times or crashes.

- **Solution**: Implement **horizontal scaling** by adding more servers, or **vertical scaling** by increasing the server's resources. Use a **load balancer** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.

## Improvements

To address the issues above, here are a few improvements that can be made to the infrastructure:

- **High Availability**: Add multiple servers and use a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy) to distribute traffic.
- **Redundant Database**: Implement MySQL replication to ensure database availability.
- **Zero Downtime Deployment**: Use strategies like blue-green deployment or containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to avoid downtime during updates.
- **Autoscaling**: Use cloud-based services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) to scale the infrastructure automatically based on traffic.

---

## Final Design Summary

- **Domain Name**: `foobar.com` with a `www` A record pointing to `8.8.8.8`
- **Web Server**: Nginx handles static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
- **Application Server**: Processes requests and interacts with MySQL for dynamic data.
- **Database**: MySQL stores all persistent data for the website.

This is a simple, one-server infrastructure to host a dynamic website at `www.foobar.com`. The design meets the basic requirements but can be improved for scalability, availability, and maintainability.
